# Note: read http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/mysql_user_module.html
# MySQL server installs with default login_user of ‘root’ and no password.
# To secure this user as part of an idempotent playbook, you must create at least two tasks:
# the first must change the root user’s password, without providing any login_user/login_password details.
# The second must drop a ~/.my.cnf file containing the new root credentials.
# Subsequent runs of the playbook will then succeed by reading the new credentials from the file.
